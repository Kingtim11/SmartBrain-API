# SmartBrain-API
The SmartBrain App is complemented by a straightforward custom RESTful API developed using NodeJS and Express. This API enables the creation and updating of user information and is seamlessly integrated with a PostgreSQL database.

**The back-end code for this API can be found in this repository. For the front-end code, please refer to the front-end repository.

Technologies employed in the Back-End include:

Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the back-end.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, facilitating the development of robust and scalable back-end applications.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database management system utilized for storing and managing data.
Knex.js: A comprehensive SQL query builder with a rich feature set, simplifying database interactions and migrations.
Together, these technologies ensure the smooth operation and efficient management of user information within the SmartBrain App.
