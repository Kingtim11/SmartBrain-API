# SmartBrain-API
The SmartBrain App is complemented by a straightforward custom RESTful API developed using NodeJS and Express. This API enables the creation and updating of user information and is seamlessly integrated with a PostgreSQL database.

**The back-end code for this API can be found in this repository. For the front-end code, please [click here](https://github.com/Kingtim11/SmartBrain-APP).**

Technologies employed in the Back-End include:

  *[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the back-end.
  *[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A web application framework for Node.js, facilitating the development of robust and scalable back-end applications.
  *[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): A powerful relational database management system utilized for storing and managing data.
  *[Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/#Builder-from): A comprehensive SQL query builder with a rich feature set, simplifying database interactions and migrations.
  
Together, these technologies ensure the smooth operation and efficient management of user information within the SmartBrain App.
